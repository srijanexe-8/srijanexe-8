## 🔭 Currently Working On
- A few side projects—some for fun, some for utility  
- Deep-diving into backend systems  
- Writing smarter, faster code


## 🔍 Beyond Code
When I'm not coding, you'll find me brainstorming new ideas, deep-diving into tech trends, leveling up my skills, or simply enjoying some quiet focus time to think and create. I value clean design, efficient logic, and collaborative innovation.
